# IPL Prediction

Dataset crawled from https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ 

Data Used-
1. IPL Schedule- Contains Date and Ground Details
2. IPL Ranking- Contains Winning Percentage and Ranking
3. IPL History- Contains Past records and the main Dataset
4. IPL Results- Contains Details about Rankings of a team from start of IPL

In this project I have tried to predict the winner based on features-

1. Overall Winning Percentage
2. Head-to-Head Winning Percentage
3. Home Ground Advantage
4. Toss Factor

Among Linear Regression, Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classification models, Random Forest Algorithm gave most accuracy of approx 84%
